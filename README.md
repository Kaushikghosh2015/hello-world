# hello-world

I am attaching the Form for change of PHONE NUMBER to get OTP, which will enable me to download the statements online. Also attached are the copies of Checkbook, ATM Card and my HKID. I have put my ATM number in the place of account number in the form, as I am not sure of the account number.
